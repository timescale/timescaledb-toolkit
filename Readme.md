# TimescaleDB Toolkit #

This repository is the home of the TimescaleDB Toolkit team. Our mission is to
ease all things analytics when using TimescaleDB, with a particular focus on
developer ergonomics and performance. Our issue tracker contains more
on [the features we're planning to work on](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit/labels/proposed-feature)
and [the problems we're trying to solve](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit/labels/feature-request),
and our [Discussions forum](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit/discussions) contains ongoing conversation.

Documentation for this version of the TimescaleDB Toolkit extension can be found
in this repository at [`docs`](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit/tree/main/docs).


## üñ• Try It Out ##

The extension comes pre-installed on all [Timescale Forge](https://console.forge.timescale.com/) instances, and also on our full-featured [`timescale/timescaledb-ha` docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescale/timescaledb-ha).

We also provide nightly builds as a docker images in `timescaledev/timescaledb-toolkit:nightly`.

All versions of the extension contain experimental features in the `toolkit_experimental`, schema see [our docs section on experimental features](/docs/README.md#tag-notes) for
more details.

## üíø Installing From Source ##

### üîß Tools Setup ###

Building the extension requires valid [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt), and clang installs, along with the postgres headers for whichever version of postgres you are running, and pgx.
We recommend installing rust using the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
and build tools, the postgres headers, in the preferred manner for your system. You may also need to install OpenSSl.
For Ubuntu you can follow the [postgres install instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/) then run
```bash
sudo apt-get install make gcc pkg-config clang postgresql-server-dev-13 libssl-dev
```
and finally, [pgx](https://github.com/zombodb/pgx), which can be installed with
```bash
cargo install cargo-pgx && cargo pgx init --pg13 pg_config
```

### üíæ Building and Installing the extension ###

Download or clone this repository, and switch to the `extension` subdirectory, e.g.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit && \
cd timescaledb-toolkit/extension
```
Then run
```
cargo pgx install --release && \
cargo run --manifest-path ../tools/post-install/Cargo.toml -- pg_config
```

To initialize the extension afer installation, star enter the following into `psql`:
```
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb_toolkit;
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Get Involved ##

The TimescaleDB Toolkit project is still in the initial planning stage as we
decide our priorities and what to implement first. As such, now is a great time
to help shape the project's direction! Have a look at the
[list of features we're thinking of working on](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit/labels/proposed-feature)
and feel free to comment on the features, expand the list, or
hop on the [Discussions forum](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-toolkit/discussions) for more in-depth discussions.

### üî® Testing ###

See above for prerequisites and installation instructions.

You can run tests against a postgres version
`pg12`, or `pg13` using

```
cargo pgx test ${postgres_version}
```
